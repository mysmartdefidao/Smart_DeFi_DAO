# Smart_DeFi_DAO
We are an ecosystem called Smart DeFi DAO. 
Smart means intelligent, and it represents our brand identity. DeFi stands for decentralized finance, meaning that our information storage system and financial payment system operate in a decentralized and blockchain based manner. 
DAO is our execution model, which means it is people centric. There is no CEO or admin; everything is operated 100% by the people, and 100% of the project's revenue is distributed to the people.
Decentralized projects operate through smart contracts, which must exist directly on the blockchain to be valid.
We currently have four smart contracts:
Smart DeFi NetWork, Smart DeFi Bank, Smart DeFi Gift, Smart DeFi Pay.
This ecosystem was invented for the first time in the world in 2022 by combining network marketing and blockchain, and it has been implemented on the global blockchain platform Binance, www.BscScan.com.
Until now, systems in the world were centralized meaning there was a central site and server where information was stored, and the CEO or admin had access to user information and the financial system, with the ability to modify or shut down the system.
But in Smart DeFi DAO, all such access has been removed. There is no off button, no ability to change or edit, no expiration date, and no central server.
The Smart DeFi NetWork project is a decentralized marketing network on the Binance blockchain with 100% payout. Its purpose is to create a community of users for Smart DeFi DAO to participate in various ecosystem projects and simultaneously grow the SBT digital currency.
The Smart DeFi Bank smart contract is a decentralized bank containing the SBT currency, liquidity dollars, and the bank’s financial backing.
SBT stands for Smart Bank Token.
A total of 21 million SBT has been created, all of which has been deposited into the bank, and none belongs to the founding team. When the liquidity reaches $1 million, the ability to buy and sell SBT inside the bank will be activated.
Every cryptocurrency requires liquidity and backing. In Smart DeFi DAO, every hour a portion of the Smart DeFi NetWork users’ income is deposited into Smart Bank. In return, all 21 million SBT and 100% of the bank's liquidity belong to Smart DeFi NetWork users not even to the project founders.
If a founder wishes to use any features of the project, they must register in the Smart DeFi NetWork just like everyone else and work the same way.
Networkers increase the value of SBT every hour. Therefore, to buy SBT, you must once contribute to networkers and become a member of Smart DeFi NetWork. Only then are you permitted to buy SBT, because networkers deposit approximately $100,000 monthly into SBT through their activities, causing SBT to increase in value every hour.
Bulk purchase of SBT is impossible in order to prevent whales, and only Smart DeFi DAO members have the right to purchase SBT.
Anyone can register with popular and reputable crypto wallets by paying $100 directly on the Binance blockchain through the Smart DeFi NetWork smart contract. They become SBT owners, Smart Bank shareholders, and partners in all Smart DeFi DAO ecosystem projects.
Upon registration, users also receive SBT AirDrop.
The $100 registration fee is distributed among users by the Smart DeFi NetWork smart contract in less than 1 hour:
•	$90 goes to networkers.
•	$5 is distributed as a gift through the Smart DeFi Gift smart contract to users who have not yet built a network.
Each person can win 20 times, earning a total of $100, enabling them to participate for free.
Since there is no CEO, the reward payment button is clicked by users. Of the remaining $5, the person who presses the button. 
Since Binance block fees are currently very low, $5 is a lot for a button presser. Currently, $0.5 is enough, so 4.5% is deposited into the SBT backend.
Additionally, 10% of the networkers’ income is permanently deposited into the SBT fund in Smart Bank. This means that dollars flow from higher-level networkers to lower-level SBT holders. Thus, in Smart DeFi NetWork, dollars are also paid from uplines to downlines.
As a result, substantial amounts of dollars are deposited into SBT every hour.
Have you ever seen a token whose value increases every hour? This has never existed in the world.
When the SBT fund exceeds $1 million, the buy and sell buttons open, and SBT liquidity will grow exponentially.
Considering the growth of digital currency in the past 10 years, with a simple calculation we can estimate that SBT can grow by thousands or even millions of percent.
Our information storage and financial payment system is DeFi, meaning that dollars are not sent to a person or wallet, but are deposited directly into the Smart DeFi NetWork smart contract. The contract without any human access or intervention holds the digital currency, calculates the rewards, and pays them to users after one hour. All transactions are visible on the blockchain. This represents 100% security for users and networkers.
When you introduce 1 new user on the left and 1 new user on the right, you get a balance, or Point, or share, which pays $90. Every hour, the total $90 is divided by the total number of Points, the value of each Point is determined, and rewards are paid to users. The contract balance resets to zero, and the next hour begins. This process continues on the Binance blockchain forever.
We have now surpassed 70,000 users, and the average value of each Point is $20.
So by introducing two users, you receive your first network reward.
From then on, even without personally introducing more people, you receive rewards from new users joining your left and right branches through your sub-groups because you created this network, and without you it would not exist.
You do not need real time balance to earn rewards. If you register in a small branch, you receive a reward within less than 1 hour. If you register in your larger branch, it is stored on blockchain with no expiration and will be rewarded the moment a user registers in your smaller branch.
To ensure rewards reach everyone and to maintain balance value stability, there is an income ceiling rule. Each user receives 5 rewards per hour, and the rest overflows to the sub groups. Again, dollars are being paid from top to bottom.
Five bonuses per hour means $100 per hour, $2,400 per day, and $72,000 per month.
When your balance exceeds 100, your income ceiling doubles to 10 bonuses per hour, equaling 240 reward per day, 1,680 reward per week, and about $130,000 per month.
In fact, networkers receive full Reward from the first day, and only after their balance exceeds 100 does 10% of their income get deposited into the SBT account.
This means you receive your first 100 bonuses in full.
Each user allows introducing only 2 users. If you want to introduce a third user, there is no place to register, and the third reward goes to your subordinates.
However, you can register with $300 and 3 wallets to receive more SBT and get $40 rewards for introducing the third person.
Let’s examine potential income:
Each balance is worth $20, and the reward for a 3 wallets registration is $60.
If you introduce 2 people and they introduce 2 people each, your team becomes 4, then 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, and eventually thousands. With proper training and now with over 70,000 existing users this growth becomes achievable for you as well.
If one registration happens on your left and one on your right daily, your income is $1800 monthly.
If five registrations occur on each side daily, you earn $9000 monthly.
This is achievable with 10 new daily registrations 300 monthly, and ~4,000 yearly. With an 8 billion world population, is 4,000 users per year too many? You only need to introduce 2 users and train them to do the same.
Note: This is not a get-rich-quick scheme. You are rewarded based on the network you build. A balance of 1 gives you 1 reward; a balance of 1000 gives you 1000 rewards. Without building a network, there is no network reward everything depends on your activity.
When the bank's backing exceeds $1 million, you also earn from users buying SBT in the bank.
Smart Bank rewards are instantaneous, not hourly. When someone in your network buys SBT, you instantly receive rewards. No balance condition applies, and it doesn’t matter whether the buyer is on your left or right branch.
The higher your balance, the more SBT you are allowed to buy, and every time your network buys SBT, you receive rewards again from the same individuals.
Smart Bank has three reward plans:
1.	Uni-Level:
Rewards from 7 levels, with no balance condition, available from day one even with 1 branch.
Users buy SBT multiple times, meaning hundreds of rewards from a single branch.
o	7 levels with 1 branch = 128 people × 5 purchases = 600+ rewards
o	7 levels with 2 branches = 256 people × 5 purchases = 1,200+ rewards
2.	Break Away:
When you reach a balance of 100, you will receive rewards from your entire team and from both branches simultaneously.
With a balance of 1,000, this reward doubles; with 10,000, it quadruples.
3.	Big Reward:
1% of the total SBT bank reserve is distributed to users who reach balances of 100,000 and 1,000,000.

The next project is Smart DeFi Pay a digital currency payment gateway for businesses.
Brands introduce themselves to Smart DeFi DAO users through the Smart Pay gateway, and instead of paying for advertising on billboards and media, they distribute the same cost as rewards to Smart members. In return, Smart members support these brands, consume their products, and introduce them to others. This reward is paid through network structure, turning each brand into a network company through Smart Pay. Here, you earn network rewards from daily marketplace purchases from millions of stores worldwide.
First goal is to use network marketing, digital currency, and Smart members to support industries and production.
Second goal is to create new income streams for people.
A portion of Smart DeFi Pay transactions is also deposited into the SBT backend in Smart Bank, causing the price of SBT to increase every minute and second.
Thus, in Smart DeFi DAO, you have a valuable product, you create added economic value, and you support national industries.
Next, Smart Shop will be launched, allowing Smart users to sell their personal products as a network using the Smart Pay gateway, enabling each Smart member to operate like a network marketing company.
We also have Smart Academy.
Users who reach a balance of 100,000 undergo an intensive course and become university level instructors, teaching seven major skills. Graduates receive an international degree after two semesters, approved by prestigious universities worldwide.
The goal of Smart DeFi DAO is to scientifically develop the network marketing and digital currency industries worldwide, as they represent the next generation of business.
